    <p style="color:#80ffff;">The Wanderer is a playable Anemo character in Genshin Impact.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The Wanderer came into existence in place of his previous incarnation after the latter expunged his previous appellations and their respective histories from Irminsul. Harboring his former self's memories after willingly regaining them, <strong>"Wanderer"</strong> is now the only title he goes by, for he has no home, no kin, and no destination.</p>

    <p>The Wanderer's thoughts on lesser lord kusanali:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wanderer/Voice-Overs"> While I still had value as a pawn, she might have had other reasons to keep me alive. It's certainly possible that it was because she's wise or benevolent, or happened to see a hint of loneliness within me... You think I'm trying to think the worst of her? Hah, did you really expect anything else? In case you've forgotten, I'm no saint.</blockquote>
