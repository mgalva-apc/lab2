    <h1>The Wanderer</h1>
    <p>A wayfaring figure whose identity is a mystery. He dresses like a mountain ascetic, but he certainly does not act the part.</p>
    <p>The Wanderer came into existence in place of his previous incarnation after the latter expunged his previous appellations and their respective histories from Irminsul. Harboring his former self's memories after willingly regaining them, "Wanderer" is now the only title he goes by, for he has no home, no kin, and no destination.</p>
