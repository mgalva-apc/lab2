    <blockquote cite="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wanderer/Voice-Overs"> "While I still had value as a pawn, she might have had other reasons to keep me alive. It's certainly possible that it was because she's wise or benevolent, or happened to see a hint of loneliness within me... You think I'm trying to think the worst of her? Hah, did you really expect anything else? In case you've forgotten, I'm no saint."</blockquote>
